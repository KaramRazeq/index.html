    <h1>PlayStation 1 controller</h1>
    <p>The playstion 1 controller was the first of its time. It didn't have really good quality and didn't function for us but of its time that was the future. now and days the ps1 controller is considered "terrible technology" but that's how we developed all the other controllers so that's one thing special about it, and at its time that was highly advanced technology. Another special thing about it is that when they were making to put in fact people could be playing on the bed on the floor standing up, so they made the build to make it comfortable to play in any position. Something cool that playstation used different than other companies that made gaming consoles for their button they didn't use the traditional 1,2,3,4 or a,b,c,d or just some plain buttons they used geometric shapes like the x and there square and the tringle and the circle. Now the joysticks, they spent the same amount of time on the joystick as the machine itself they were very precice on how they would make it ,so they decieded they weight on the joysticks they mesaurded it gram by gram to which was the best weight to put on the joystick for the best gaming experince. All od these things made the PS1 controller extremely advanced back then where they didnt have much technology and with all those features that was state of the art technology to them and thats what makes the PS1 controller so special.
