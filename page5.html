    <p>The Ps5 controller is the brand knew controller of all the controllers. All the colors the ps5 controller can come in are Midnight Black, Cosmic Red, Starlight Blue, Nova Pink, and Galactic Purple. The DualSense wireless controller for the PlayStation 5 was revealed on April 7, 2020. It is based on the prior DualShock controller but with modifications influenced by discussions with game designers and players. The DualSense controller has adaptive triggers with force feedback through voice coil actuators that can change the resistance to the player as necessary, supporting experiences such as virtually drawing an arrow from a bow. The DualSense maintains the same buttons as the DualShock 4, though the "Share" button was renamed to "Create" with additional means for players to create and share content. The PS5 controller has a built in mic for players who brake their mic or lost it or dont have a mic and it has alot of features to it, and the included controller speaker has been improved. It has two-tone coloring, primarily white with black facing, with the black piece being easily detachable. The light bar has been moved to the sides of the touchpad. It has USB-C connectivity, a higher-rated battery, and an audio jack. As an Easter egg, the texture of the controller unit is covered in miniature versions of the four PlayStation button symbols (cross, circle, square, and triangle). Sony revealed the DualSense Edge, a new controller for the PlayStation 5 in August 2022. The controller will feature a more modular design than the DualSense with replaceable stick modules, multiple control profiles and an option of relocating map inputs. </p>
