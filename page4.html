    <p>The DualShock 4 is the PlayStation 4's controller. It has several new features from DualShock 3. One new feature is a built-in two-point capacitive touch pad on the front of the controller, which can be clicked. This allows the touch pad to represent multiple buttons, as demonstrated in the PS4 version of Elite Dangerous in which the four corners of the touch pad can be mapped to a. The controller supports motion detection via a three-axis gyroscope and three-axis accelerometer and vibration. It includes a non-removable rechargeable 3.7 V, 1000 m lithium-ion battery, which can be charged while the system is in rest mode. It weighs 210 g (7.4 oz) and has dimensions of 162 mm × 52 mm × 98 mm (6.4 in × 2.0 in × 3.9 in). The front of the controller features a light bar containing three LEDs that, when lit in conjunction, cause the light bar to glow a variety of colors. Developed for PlayStation VR, it can be used to identify players by matching the colors of the characters they control in a game, or to provide enhanced feedback or immersion by changing patterns or colors in reaction to gameplay. An early example of this is displayed in the game Grand Theft Auto V; the light bar will flash red and blue when the player is wanted by the police, simulating the flashing lights of a police car. The light bar is also used in conjunction with the PlayStation Camera to judge the positions and movements of multiple players.</p>
